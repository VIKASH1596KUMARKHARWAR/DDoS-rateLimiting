# DDoS Protection with Rate Limiting and CAPTCHA

This project implements rate limiting and CAPTCHA protection mechanisms to safeguard applications from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. It leverages the express-rate-limit library for rate limiting and includes a CAPTCHA feature to mitigate brute force attempts, offering a comprehensive solution to improve the security of web applications.

## Features

- **Rate Limiting:** Protects your application from excessive requests by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a specified time window.
- **DDoS Protection:** Guards against DDoS attacks by controlling traffic volume, preventing system overload and maintaining application performance.
- **Captcha Protection:** Adds an additional layer of security by requiring CAPTCHA verification for certain sensitive actions (e.g., password reset or login attempts).
